Title
CCNA Project 01 – Router-on-a-Stick VLAN Segmentation (Hardened Design)
1. Project Objective

Explain in 4–6 lines:

Segment departments using VLANs

Implement inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick

Harden trunk links (native VLAN isolation, DTP disabled)

Separate management traffic (VLAN 99)

Apply edge security (PortFast + BPDU Guard)

Keep it concise.

2. Topology Overview

Insert:
